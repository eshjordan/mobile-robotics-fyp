# agent_local_comms_server
This package provides a server to enforce local (proximity-based)
communication between multiple agents.
It effectively acts in place of an on-board signal strength-based
communication manager (as could be implemented for Bluetooth via RSSI),
and allows Wi-Fi communication to be range-limited.
