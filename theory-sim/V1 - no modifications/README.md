### Visualisation for Loss of Distributed Coverage - Algorithm 4, followed by Algorithm 6 naive extension

Main algorithm is implemented in `algos.py`, "pairwise_interactions"

Will need to `pip install pygame`

To run: `python main.py 7` where 7 is the number of agents.

Press enter in terminal to step through the iterations and observe coverage over time.

I personally find it didn't really display correctly on Windows python, but works fine inside WSL.
